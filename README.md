# Assignment2
A space war game where you shoot aliens and their mothership.
To navigate right and left use the right and left arrows on your keyboard, to shoot press the spacebar.
The more aliens you shoot the more points you gain. Likewise the more ships you shoot your point tally grows.
This is a very simple one level shooting game.  I hope to add more levels in the future along with some sounds.
